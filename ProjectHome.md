It's an academic computer program written in C++ for serial simulation of two-phase oil-water flow in heterogeneous and anisotropic porous media using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in unstructured 2-D meshes. Methods still under development are:

1) h-Refinement
2) Adaptive remeshing (Gmsh)
3) Adaptive remeshing (MadLib)
